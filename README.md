![vivide-logo](images/logo.png)

A programming environment and framework that supports *interactive*, *data-driven*, *scriptable* construction of graphical tools with low effort. It is implemented in Squeak/Smalltalk.

##Important Announcement

This 4.0 branch is used to develop a version of Vivide that has no external dependencies other than provided by [Squeak Trunk](http://squeak.org/downloads/). This means that the following dependent projects will be removed from the core system to some extras package:

* [Signals](https://github.com/hpi-swa/signals)
* [Animations](https://github.com/hpi-swa/animations)
* [Widgets](https://github.com/hpi-swa/widgets)

Other dependencies includes JSON, Refactoring-Core, and OCompletion. All these projects do enrich the Vivide experience but are not necessary for the core concepts.

##How to Install [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hpi-swa/vivide.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hpi-swa/vivide)

1. Get [Squeak 4.6 or later](http://www.squeak.org) with a recent [CogVM](http://www.mirandabanda.org/files/Cog/VM/) for your operating system.
2. If not already integrated, load [Metacello](https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work). Learn how it [works](https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloUserGuide.md).
3. Finally, load VIVIDE into your Squeak image:

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'Vivide';
  repository: 'github://hpi-swa/vivide:4.0/repository';
  load.
```

Then, create and enter a new *animated Morphic project*. There, your can open Vivide with ```VivideLight open```.

See [FAQ](https://github.com/hpi-swa/vivide/wiki/FAQ) for further information.
